      <h2>Early life and education</h2>
      <p>
        Gladwell decided to pursue advertising as a career after
        college.[15][18] After being rejected by every advertising agency he
        applied to, he accepted a journalism position at conservative magazine
        The American Spectator and moved to Indiana.[19] He subsequently wrote
        for Insight on the News, a conservative magazine owned by Sun Myung
        Moon's Unification Church.[20] In 1987, Gladwell began covering business
        and science for The Washington Post, where he worked until 1996.[21] In
        a personal elucidation of the 10,000-hour rule he popularized in
        Outliers, Gladwell notes, "I was a basket case at the beginning, and I
        felt like an expert at the end. It took 10 years—exactly that long."[15]

      <h2>Works</h2>
      <p>
        With the release of Revenge of the Tipping Point: Overstories,
        Superspreaders, and the Rise of Social Engineering in 2024, Gladwell has
        had eight books published. When asked for the process behind his
        writing, he said: "I have two parallel things I'm interested in. One is,
        I'm interested in collecting interesting stories, and the other is I'm
        interested in collecting interesting research. What I'm looking for is
        cases where they overlap".
